## About Me

I grew up in southern California, in a town called Simi Valley. I am the oldest of four; I have two younger sisters, and one younger brother. I love chess, cooking, and motorcycles! I will happily have a lengthy conversation about any of those topics, anywhere, anytime. 

## About this Site

I created this site for multiple purposes. First and foremost, I want to get my projects that I have worked on out there so that I can properly showcase my abilities! I love coming up with new projects to do, and I am constantly pushing myself beyond my limits. I love to experiment with new ideas and technologies so that I can grow as a professional and a person. I love to learn about math, science, and technology because that is what is driving innovation today. 

I sincerely hope that this portfolio adequately represents my passion!

# Andrew Belz's Data Science Portfolio
 This is a quarto website that holds my data science portfolio. It is published on GitHub pages and is available for viewing. It is a work in progress, so if there are any broken links and there is something that you would like to see feel free to reach out to me and I will gladly send it! 
 
 Otherwise, feel free to navigate to the `_site` folder to find the contents of the site.

The workflow is designed to make edits within the Quarto markdown files, then publish to the `_site` folder with the command `quarto publish gh-pages` in the terminal.
